# max-arduino_interactive-saxophone

## Purpose
I am currently (2022) working on an improvisation performance setup that involves a plastic saxophone ([jSax](https://www.nuvoinstrumental.com/products/jsax/)) with sensors connected to an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) microcontroller that communicate wirelessly to Max (by Cycling'74) to control parameters of effects Iâ€™ve coded in Max.

This is a documentation of hardware and software developments of my augmented instrument.

Below is a photo of my first improvisation setup with the jSax and a photo of the jSax with the BNO080 IMU. I used a great deal of pedals (hooked to Arduinos), a MIDI Fighter Twister, and the always awesome [Metric Halo](https://mhsecure.com/metric_halo/home.html) ULN-8.
