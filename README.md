# max-arduino_interactive-saxophone

## Purpose
I am currently (2022) working on an improvisation performance setup that involves sending real-time data from sensors on a plastic saxophone ([jSax](https://www.nuvoinstrumental.com/products/jsax/)) to control parameters of effects in Max (by [Cycling'74](https://cycling74.com))

This is a documentation of hardware and software developments of my augmented instrument. I'm starting this project using the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) microcontroller because that is what I am most familiar with. The wireless technology I'm using (to keep from being tethered to the computer) is Xbee.

Below is a photo of my first improvisation setup with the jSax and a photo of the jSax with the BNO080 IMU. I used a great deal of pedals (hooked to Arduinos), a MIDI Fighter Twister, and the always awesome [Metric Halo](https://mhsecure.com/metric_halo/home.html) ULN-8.
